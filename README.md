## User Stories

- Homepage shows app features and links to login or register an account.
- User can create a new account and/or login.
- User can add plants to their "My Plants" section, creating a name, adding plant type, image url, room name, window direction, and notes about plant.
- Once a plant is added, user can edit or delete plant.
- User can complete watering tasks in their "My Tasks" section, as they are auto-generated after creating a new plant.
- User can add a plant status for any plant, adding status date, plant health (poor/good/excellent), and notes. Status can be edited or deleted.

## GA Project Requirements (MVP - MERN App Project #3)

- A full-stack application (React + Node/Express/MongoDB)
- MVC file structure: Models, Views, Controllers (Note: React is views)
- At least one new model with full CRUD
- At least three react components, besides App.js
- Deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
- Two git repositories, one for backend and one for frontend
- A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes
- Links to hosted and working apps

## Capstone Project MVP Goals:
- Current models: Plants, Status
- New model: User
- Improve design and add Responsive Design

## Capstone Project Stretch Goals:
- Add image upload capability
- Search functionality
- Front end sort by room name or A-Z plant name
- Possibly include weather API - shows current weather and suggests more/less watering?



<!-- ## Project Stretch Goals

- Wireframing (created via Figma)
- Favicon/Logo
- Plant modals (add new plant / edit plant)
- Plant default image, if no image url given
- Form dropdown menus
- React routing:
    - Homepage: `'/'`
    - Login: `'/login'`
    - Register: `'/register'`
    - User Dashboard: `'/dashboard'` -->


<!-- ## Future Goals
These are additions I wasn't able to get to within project timeframe, but want to implement in the future:

- Responsive Design
- API: It was difficult to find a public plant API that worked for my project. Hoping to expand on this later on.
- Model Updates:
    - Plant:
        - `pet_friendly = models.BooleanField` (possibly based on toxicity level)
        - `maintenance = ? ` (possibly based on hardiness)
    - Task (Water):
        - `schedule = ? ` (possibly based on drought/humidity resistance)
- Additional CRUD for User model:
    - Create new user
    - Update/Delete user account
    - User login/logout (username/password authentication)
- Search functionality for user added plants
- Upcoming Tasks React component
- Plant image upload via Cloudinary
- Sort plants and tasks by room name or alphabetical -->
